# SENTIMENTAL_ANALYSIS
Sentiment Analysis Using Logistic Regression in MLlib	
Objective: Perform sentiment analysis on a text dataset using logistic regression.	

Process:	

1 Use a labeled dataset - movie reviews with positive/negative labels.
2 Preprocess the text data: tokenize, remove stopwords, and convert to a TF-IDF representation.
3 Train a logistic regression model to classify text as positive or negative.
4 Experiment with different regularization parameters to optimize the model.

Evaluation:	
	Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to evaluate model performance.
	Analyze feature weights to understand which words have the highest impact on sentiment.
	Compare the performance of logistic regression with other MLlib classifiers like Naive Bayes or Decision Trees.
